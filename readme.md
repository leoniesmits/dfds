# [DFDS verhalenwebsite](https://leoniesmits.github.io/dfds/)

A school assignment where we made a story website in style of DFDS. 

## The Assignment

The assignment was given in Project Web, where visual, UX and front-end were all tested. 

## The site

The site is a gallery of stories, with a search bar that folds out to more options. I used the design of Pinterest as an example, where searchterms are buttons that can be deleted.
